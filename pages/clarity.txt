Hey you! Yes, you! There's a game here! Find the pages on this website that have music clips or images. Most of them will have a secret code! Find the secret codes, go to the @[Rampage Room>rampage-room.html], type in the codes, and, if you're right, then you'll be able to see all of my projects that haven't been finished yet!
