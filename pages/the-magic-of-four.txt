![Introduction]
Hello again. This isn't as dumb as #[Bad Math] article, but I'll try to keep it as close to that as possible.
For some context, I was scrolling through @[Instagram>https://www.instagram.com/], and I found this meme page I follow, @[acf3301>https://www.instagram.com/acf3301/].
He had something in his story, so I clicked on it and saw a meme that added S=1+2+3+4+... by grouping every number after 1 in groups of threes, like this: S=1+(2+3+4)+(5+6+7)+...
After that, they added it all up, like this: S=1+9+18+27+...
+
Then they factored out 9 like this: S=1+9(1+2+3+4+5+...), which led them to S=1+9S, which meant that S=-1/8.
This is much like the @[Ramanujan Summation>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_summation].
I saw this, and I went, "I wanna try this!"
And so, here we are.
+
![What Actually Happened]
So I started off well (at least that's what I thought).
I started off with S=1+2+3+4+5+6+...
+
Then I added every number in pairs, which led me to S=3+7+11+15+...
+
After that, I tried writing this new S as an arithmetic sequence: S(n)=3+(n-1)4=4n-1. This leads me to two discoveries:
+
  1. This is useless in what I was trying to accomplish.
+
  2. The common difference in S(n) is 4.
+
And with that, I started a new endeavor.
+
![Differences and Sets, the Importance of Four]
Of course, I didn't realize that I was going to be setting sail on a new ship. No, not at all. Instead, I tried again, at first.
This time I tried adding every number after 1 in pairs, which led me to S=1+5+9+13+...
+
But again, this is useless in the problem I was trying to solve. But, I saw a similar pattern here as well. If I write the integers of this new S as a set, I get {1,5,9,13,...}.
+
The common difference in this set after the first term is also 4, just like in the arithmetic sequence I made on my first attempt. That's kinda cool, isn't it?
+
This four sparked a new idea.
+
![Les resultats (The Results)]
So then, after a lot of fooling around with these sets and sequences, this is what I found out:
+
  1. Given any set a={n,n+1,n+2,...}: if set b is {n+n+1,n+2+n+3,n+4+n+5,...}, then the common difference (d) is 4.
+
  2. Given any set a={n,n+1,n+2,...}: if set b is {}
